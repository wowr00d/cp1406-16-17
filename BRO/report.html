<h2>Testing Details</h2>
<p> any details required to test the site - Can someone write the testing instructions here (     )</p>
<p>Our site had numerous issues when put through testing.<br> These issues were:</p>
<ul>
    <li> The information throughout the site does not link to other pages enough. (Not enough in text refrencing/linking.)</li>
    <li>The form had some major validation issues in which it wasnt submitting or accepting correct data inputed.</li>
    <li>The form was not posting the information to anywhere, and there was no option to take the users back.</li>
    <li>There was a bombardment of information and we needed to implement a method to minimize the amount of text displayed</li>
</ul>

<h2>References - somone will need to get this for fb feeds and stuff or no?</h2>
<p>references (links) for any code, images or content that you have used that are not your own</p>
<ul>
    <li>...</li>
</ul>
<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> <ul><li>Communication was maintained mostly throughout the project</li><li>Everyone played their part in making the assignment - whether that be design, information finding, validating, css...</li><li>Practical attendances were kept high to maintain contact between eachother and to plan what and who will do what the week to follow.</li><li> add more here if needed</li></ul></p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong><ul><li>There were not many minuses or negative aspects throughout the project except for on testing day it would have been better to be more prepared as a group, with a more complete sight and predetermined questions for the testers.</li><li>add more here if needed...</li><ul></p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> (including significant lessons) <ul><li>Our group had people who were very specifaclly good with certain things. E.g. One person had their expertise in design and css, another in js and form handling, image manipulation and as well as this, information sorting and relevancing.</li><li>Add your ones here....</li></ul></p>
