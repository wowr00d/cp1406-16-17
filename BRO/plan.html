<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group 17</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong>Declan Evanson, Justin Nix, Lincoln Corbett, Sharyn Barr</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>It is our websites aim to directly increase the volume of tickets sold per concert at which the barrier reef orchestra performs and to increase  the amount of revenue the orchestra makes over all by increasing benefactor donations and ( - Do we want to mention a change to a younger target audience here? Add more or change if you want).  </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>In order to measure the success of our product/website, the number of recorded sales pre product released sold can be compared to that sold when our product has been implemented for a certain amount of time. This is also the same case for donations/ benefactors.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Our website is primarily targetted towards a younger age range, that is, people who are 15-25 years old as these people will be continuing, maintaining and supporting the orchestra as years are to come. However said, since the client desires donations and benefactors, we must also appropriate our site towards people who are of class and respect. </p>
